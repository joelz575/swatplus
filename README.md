# SWAT+ Model repository (almost) clone

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/joelz575/swatplus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/joelz575/swatplus)

This repository is (mostly) a clone of the official SWAT+ one available [here](https://bitbucket.org/blacklandgrasslandmodels/modular_swatplus/src/master/). A few major differences are:
* We only store source code in the git repository. This means that documentation, compiled executables, and example data are **not** included. It also means that you will not download a nearly 1-GB git repo when you clone it.
* Releases for MacOS, Windows and Linux are all automatically compiled and published in the releases tab (magic!)
* Added option for dynamic model linking (documentation to follow)

We will always try to keep this repostitory as up to date as possible compared to the main SWAT+ code. Pull requests are welcome!
